## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*
<!-- - Showing features of the property.
- Things to do in the city or town for a family vacation
- Want help in deciding where to go.
- Points and rewards to travel with groups.
- Travel with friends and then travel with family.
- Travel is usually around a week or so.
- Make hero image more realistic. That way they can see that the website has things that are available for them.
- Hover to get a brief overview.
- Make pictures more attractive.
- Have to do a lot of digging in order to find what they are looking for. -->
- The user research suggests that customers want help in looking for the ideal location and that their location have something for them. Both users made clear that they were a bit indecisive with the location that they wanted. With the quantitative research, the highest percentage was not knowing what location they wanted, which goes along with what the customers said in the video. It was also mentioned that being inspired by what they see on the website can help. They wanted something from the website that can make that process easier. When looking for a location, both customers were quite frustrated with the format that they had of the map and all the states to look for a location. It made them feel overwhelmed. They wanted a website that made them feel that it did have something for them. It was important for them to be able to look for key features that they wanted, such as location, but also activites because a vacation to them is one where you go out and explore and not stay couped in the home. I belive the users desired an experience that would help give them options for what they were either looking for or give them inspiration.
